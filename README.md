# onebox-int-api

## API for internal communications of Onebox Integration Platform, 
This will be used for connections between Rest front end, internal dispatcher and any 3rd party supplier connector. And will be exposed as the new main and public Onebox API.

To do so, we have used a API Blueprint standard and apiary.io as a main editing and mocking tool.
